What are you thankful for?
==========================

"What are you thankful for?" asks viewers to send messages of thanks via SMS, which appear in real-time thanks to [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) (using the excellent [EmberFire](https://github.com/firebase/emberFire) bindings).
